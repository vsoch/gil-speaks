Dear `<software>`,<br>

The fact that I can open a file, whether binary or text, in your interface, make absolutely no changes other than exporting it to a different format, and you add a * and then ask me if I want to save changes? I didn't make any changes, but you clearly took me opening you as an invitation to stick your grubby hands into the metadata of my file. And even when that raw file is text based, like svg? And you still do this!? This is (metaphorically) just as icky as not asking for consent. Get your nasty hands out of my data files and if you try to stick a fast one on me again, I'm going to purge the entirety of your bits into Timbuktu you sneaky little mother trucker!<br>

Best,<br>

`<developer>`<br>
