# Gil Speaks

What does Gil Speak? This small portal exists solely to answer that question,
and to capture all the wisdom that he has shared over the years. 
While not all quotes are entirely his (some might have been uttered by a dinosaur)
the majority set are, and we will continue to add wisdom in the years to come.
